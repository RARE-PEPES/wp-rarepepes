Contributors: Jeff Ruoss<br>
Tested up to: 6.2.2<br>
Requires PHP: 8.1<br>

## Description

This plugin provides a shortcode that you can use to fetch and display data about rare assets.

You can use the shortcode like this:

```html
[rp name="ASSET_NAME"]
```

Replace "ASSET_NAME" with the name of the asset you want to display data for.

When you hover over the link that the shortcode generates, it will display a tooltip with data fetched from the API.

## Installation
